Ansible OpenCV role
===================
Installs latest OpenCV with contrib from source.


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: all
      roles:
         - { role: ansible-opencv }
